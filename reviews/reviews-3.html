        <p>My kids are enjoying this toy quite a bit. There are multiple modes to play. If the power is on, the game
            talks and has music. Unfortunately, two of the bubbles seem to depress on their own. My kids range from
            toddler to teen. I would say they all enjoyed this game. It's not quite an electronic, so I think of it as
            more of a manual light up game. Definitely recommend.</p>

        <p>got this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. It's small so it doesn't take up much room on the
            bathroom counter. Super simple to use with easy to follow directions. Gets the brushes perfectly clean. This
            is a great value.</p>
