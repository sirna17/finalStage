            <span>If you don‚Äôt mind drinking out of it‚Ä¶</span>
        </div>
        <p>It‚Äôs a good concept and it works only if you don‚Äôt mind drinking out of it with a very long straw. the ice
            cubes stick together and clump up and won‚Äôt come out of the small spout if they made the spout bigger maybe
            they could come out this thing. Also is half the ice cubes break up and a little shards but it works just
            fine for my iced coffee as long as I pour my drink in the contraption</p>

            <span>Ingenious! What a clever device!</span>
        </div>
        <p>Ice balls are the current fad. One big ball of ice in the high ball glass with a couple of shots of your
            favorite bourbon seems to be the 'thing' these days. So, why not a bunch of grape sized balls of ice in your
            favorite mixed drink? If that's your thing, this is the gadget for you. Following the directions, this
            device will produce enough ice in one making to chill down two beverages. (TIP... keep your alcohol in the
            freezer and your mixer in the fridge. That keeps your beverage colder longer and prevents melting and
            watering down. Also, use a good quality glass double wall glass.) This ice ball maker works very well. Good
            purchase. Five stars.</p>

            <span>So so helpful!!!!</span>
        </div>
        <p>This thing made my life so much easier!!!!! I‚Äôm a heavy coffee drinker and iced coffee is undoubtedly THE
            BEST! This product is super easy to use- literally just fill it up with water, leave it in the freezer, the
            next day, pop that open and boom! Frozen water cubes out!I love it so much it speeds up my daily coffee
            process so much and I finally don‚Äôt need to use the ice cubes trays to get out ice one by one! Definitely
            10/10!!!</p>

            <span>Ice ball maker, a great invention!!! works perfect</span>
        </div>
        <p>I have a traditional ice tray, but sometimes I wanted to have nice ice balls for drinks.I just came across
            this ice ball maker and I was really curious how well it would work.honestly, it worked out perfect. easy to
            fill water and even easier to pull the side plastics to get those nice and round ice balls out of the
            container.it does not give you whole lot of ice balls, but it does give me enough for my drinks.I am a happy
            customer.</p>
