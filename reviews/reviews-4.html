        <h4>‚ú® New Upgrade :</h4>
        <p>Different from other cosmetic brush cleaning tools, this electric makeup
            brush cleaner machine(Patented design) improves the concave and convex parts of the cleaning
            area, and heightens the convex part so that they can fully contact the interior of the
            cleaning brush and wash the cosmetic residues.</p>
        <h4>üòâ USB Power Supply :</h4>
        <p>This makeup brush cleaner machine(Patented design) uses the USB
            plug-in method to work, abandoning the traditional battery power supply method, and it can
            be used when the power is turned on and the switch is pressed.</p>
        <h4>üòª Protect Makeup Brushes :</h4>
        <p>Excessive cleaning speed will reduce the service life of makeup
            brushes. The moderate rotation speed of this beauty blender cleanser(Patented design), can
            not only deep clean the residues of makeup brushes, but also prevent the bristles on the
            makeup brushes from being damaged, gentle cleaning.</p>
        <h4>‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• Save Time :</h4>
        <p>The cleaning port of this silicone brush cleaner(Patented design) is large,
            and there are many protrusions inside, which can clean multiple makeup brushes at the same
            time, and there is no limit to the size of the makeup brushes, saving time and effort.</p>
        <h4>ü§© Portable & Lightweight:</h4>
        <p>The size of this electric makeup brush cleaner machine(Patented
            design) is only 3.4x3.5 inches, it is small in size and lightweight, it will not take up too
            much desktop area, and it can also be placed in bags, suitcases, luggage, and is easy to
            carry.</p>

        </div>
        <p>I seen an ad for this product and decided to give it a try. At first sight it looked flimsy and I
            thought I would still have to clean it again until the water ran clear NOPE!!! When I rinsed it the
            bristles were white and the brush was CLEAN!!! I put some liquid makeup brush cleaner from Sigma and
            water in the silicone bowl, put my brush in, turned it on and counted to 20 and viola! The water
            turned brown and my brush was CLEAN! I washed about 15 more face brushes ranging from short and
            dense bristles to long and thin and they all turned white and was clean. In the past when I used my
            brush cleaner mat it took a while but with this device my brushes were clean in no time! I highly
            recommend this makeup brush cleaner! I‚Äôm buying another one to have a backup just in case..</p>

        <p>I have been cleaning my makeup brushes by hand and it takes a lot of time so it doesn‚Äôt happen as
            often as it should. Enter this product which has exceeded my expectations! Takes makeup off brushes
            and beauty blenders like magic! If you don‚Äôt have this‚Ä¶do yourself a favor and buy it!</p>

        <p>I got this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. It's small so it doesn't take up much room on the
            bathroom counter. Super simple to use with easy to follow directions. Gets the brushes perfectly clean. This
            is a great value.</p>
