        </div>
        <p>Bought for myself to use at work. Hubby realized what it was and hijacked my blender. Guess I will buy him
            his own for Christmas</p>

        </div>
        <p>I can't believe I actually got one I've been searching for a while for this particular one and I've gotten
            fake. I also got the coverage in case there's a mishap in the next two to three years and is well worth it
            and blends well..... It can blend with Ice or I see fruits , a blender that's easy to clean, and has
            Durability .</p>

            <span>Pretty Good</span>
        </div>
        <p>It's a pretty good blender for the price but the bottom was a little leaky. I'm not sure if my blender was
            defective or what but that would be my only challenge. It blends well but the leaky bottom was a huge no for
            me. </p>

            <span>Quite good. Small imo</span>
        </div>
        <p>Quite good. Does what it's advertised although I didn't realise it's quite small. Think of I can only fit
            half chopped banana and half chopped apples with some yoghurt and milk. 🫠. Other than the size it's highly
            recommended</p>
