        <p>I was a little hesitant of buying it but once it got here I fell in love. It cleans monitors without
            scratching, it cleans glasses lenses, the brushes are useful, the keycap puller is the right size to get on
            to most any profile. The only thing I haven't used much is the pick</p>
