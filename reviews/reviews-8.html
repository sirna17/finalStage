             <span> Adorable, fun, and a hit as a gift to bf</span>
         </div>
         <p>Dimmer light, wouldn't expect it to light up a room, more novelty or for low light needs. Sound is great, a giggle every time you turn it off. Bf loved it, getting more and command strips to put around the house. Charge lasts a long time so far.</p>

         </div>
         <p>My kids are Mario fans. We got this for party decor to put out for fun, and fun was had. Even the adults were pressing it! The sounds are great and sound just like the real power up in the game. We now use it as a nightlight in my sons room. It‚Äôs so fun to press and lights up just enough! Perfect gift and great price. Will definitely buy more.</p>

         <p>Bought as an early Christmas present but took it out to make sure it works. It makes the Mario Bros coin ‚Äúding‚Äù sound when turn on and another Mario Bros sound when turned off (if I remember correctly it‚Äôs the sound the plays when you die in game lol). My 6 year old will adore this!</p>
