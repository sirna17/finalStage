            Color: Makeup Pen AVerified Purchase
            I've tried the brow pen, highlighter, and lip liner so far. <br>

            brow pen: product is super soft so you have to make sure to have a light hand when drawing your hair
            strokes. it smudges pretty easily so make sure to use setting spray or a good brow gel product and don't
            touch your brows once applied.<br>

            highlighter: this one i only used to highlight my nose and it was sheer but seemed to do it's job.<br>

            lip liner: also really soft product so be careful. like it's a bit TOO creamy. also, it stains so if you're
            gonna line your lips i suggest filling it in as well so that when your lip product inevitably comes off,
            you're not stuck with just liner LOL<br>

            I still haven't used the eyeliner to tight line or anything because I'm afraid of looking like a raccoon in
            public if this goes south hahaha

            idk if i'd buy this again but I'm glad i tried it</p>

        <p>If you wear little makeup or a lot of makeup this device should be in your collection. To have an all in one
            device for eyeliner, eyeliner shadow, lip pencil and eyebrow pencil is by far the best created makeup tools.
            I wish I had though of this myself.</p>

        <p>This pen is so awesome. The lip liner is a nice neutral, the eye liner and brow filler are great. Haven't
            used the highlighter yet but am sure I will like it as well. I'm very happy I made the purchase.</p>
